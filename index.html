<h2>What is the <i>DH Algorithm</i>?</h2>
<p><big>
    The <i><b>Diffie Hellman Algorithm</b></i> is a <i><b>key exchange proctocol</b></i><i>(more on that later)</i> that  
    uses <i><b>symmetrical encryption</b></i> to make a shared and encrypted key. This is intergral  
    to two or more parties to comunicate over public channels without threat of attack  
    because of the <i><b>DLP</b></i><i>(more on that later too).</i> The amazing part of it all is its crazy  
    simplicity. No matter what in encryption method you use, you need to have a shared 
    encrypted key to begin. <i>RSA, Triple DES, AES,</i> it doesn't matter. You need <i>(at less  
    for the more secure methods)</i> a symmetrical encrypted key. That's what I like about
    DH. That's why I'm writing this.

<h2>How DH Works <i>Kinda</i></h2>
<p><big>
    like I had said, DH is relatively simple. Key Word: <i>relatively.</i> You see, there 
    is,like many things in life, a "bit" math. But before all that, we need some backgroud.
    The DH Algorithm was made by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, then published in 
    1969 in <i>"New Directions In Cryptography"</i>(Original paper can be download down below). 
    A <i><b>Key Exchange Proctocol</b></i> (told you we would come back to this) is a method of encrypting 
    a key that can only computed by how many parties are paricipating. An ouside observer 
    could know all of the transactions happening but if one specific piece of infomation 
    (which will be elaborated on further) or more isn't known, they are (for a lack of better 
    words) eternally screwed. Speaking of eternity, that brings us to the <i><b>DLP</b></i> and 
    the math of DH.

<h2>Backgroud On DH</h2>
<p><big>
    So onto to the math! For DH, there is a little known branch of arithmetic known as modular 
    arithmetic. Modular Arithmetic is a system of integers where numbers restart after reaching 
    a certain value called a modulus. It was formulated by Carl Friedrich Gauss in "Disquisitiones 
    Arithmeticae." Basically, you have a set value N and every X reach N, it resets. Here's an example
<hr color="#dddddd">
<img src = "Mod_Example2.png" style = "position:relative; left:500px;">
<hr color="#dddddd">
I'll explain it. It's simply the remainder. N is 4 and X is 0,1,2,3. But that isn't all.
It's not secure yet. Because of the modulus N resetting the all the integers less than N, it makes 
it very hard to compute a average problem (which usually comes out to 1,000 - 2,000 numbers) but 
it becomes virtually impossible when one or more key pieces of infomation is missing, which is how 
this next part works.

<h2>DH Formulas</h2>
<p><big>
    DH is secure because of the personal key. After choosing the modulus N and one of it's generator G, 
    both parties (a & b) must pick an element that is coprime to N (their personal key) and make sure that they 
    keep it to themselves. You must raise a to G and apply N. Let's say N = 7, G = 5, a = 4. It would lile this.
</big></p>
<h4>G<sup>a</sup> mod N <big><i>OR</i></big> 5<sup>4</sup> mod 7 </h4>
<p><big>
    That comes out to 2 mod 7.  All of this is to calculate your public key. The public key is the number that you 
    exchange with the second party after they calculate their own public key. For this, we need to calculate the 
    public key for both parties. We can just reuse N and it's generator, but we have chose a new private key. Let's 
    go with 3. So N = 7 & G = 5 & b = 2, now it's time to calculate B. 
</big></p>
<h4>G<sup>a</sup> mod N <big><i>OR</i></big> 5<sup>2</sup> mod 7 </h4>
<p><big>
    And that comes out to 4 mod 7. That means B = 4. Now that we have both public keys
